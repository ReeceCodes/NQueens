# NQueens
the n queens problem

I tried to design my own solution since I knew what I wanted the result to be and the rules. Unfortunately I got hung up pretty quick on how to do a few things the way I was doing it.
I had thought I could hold a list of classes that had positions and availability of the position. I quickly got stuck trying to store the last valid position (and invalid) and then invalidating diagonal values.

and the wikipedia entry:

I was able to get a solution working and it's much simpler than the version I would have had. Other than the brute force approach you can fine a single solution with various formulas on the wiki. I kind of lost interest after getting it to visually work on the screen and seeing it in action.

It is MVC but it's tied to using Umbraco CMS the way it's written. Not much but enough.
